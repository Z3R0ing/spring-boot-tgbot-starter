# z3r0ing-spring-boot-tgbot-starter

Spring Boot Starter for faster creation bots based on [org.telegram:telegrambots](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots).

### Idea

The main idea of the project is adding update processing logic for bots without editing higher level code of the logic.
Write only new code with specific for your bot logic, without editing other code.
All global checks, "if", switches, routing logic to specific logic are already implemented.
